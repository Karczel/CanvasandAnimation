# CanvasandAnimation
 LearningGraphicswithPyTkinter

# ambition:
physics bounce
- follow curve path
- hyperbola -> use speed as state y increase speed acceleration

# roll ball, stuck at border
- roll match move

# roll based on tilting of canvas/container
- gravity
- earlier features
- collision check tangent , vector, trigonometer


# screen pet + chatbox, stop and stand(change gif)
# animating balls (2 walking png) + actions png poses
- how to replace ball with object that can change gif(transparent bg) and move and change actions based on time.sleep()/time.now()
- make that object create chatbox after set time chat -> polygon in canvas / add text and show location like gif # order infront

get those with state machine probably


# idea: ai chat character + screen pet (double click to go to chat page)
- can connect chat with ai
- maybe add clicking to link to pet <button> or <app>

# curious
- can canvas display mp4?
- how to change from canvas pet to screen pet?
